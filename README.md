# Create-a-Method
A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example
Create a method inside Main:

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // code to be executed
  }
}
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Explained

myMethod() is the name of the method
static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class. You will learn more about objects and how to access methods through objects later in this tutorial.
void means that this method does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in this chapter
